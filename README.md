#### Explanation Emily 3.0

The prompt describes the functionality of a chatbot named Emily 3.0. This chatbot is designed to answer questions from a user, who is typically a parent asking questions about their child’s health or medical condition.

The chatbot uses several variables to formulate its responses:

**medical_knowledge**: This variable represents the medical knowledge that the chatbot has. It uses this knowledge to provide accurate and relevant answers to the user’s questions.  
**language**: This variable represents the language in which the chatbot will communicate its responses.  
**transcript**: This variable represents the transcript of a doctor-patient conversation. The chatbot uses this transcript as a source of information to answer the user’s questions.  
**knowledge_base**: This variable represents a broader base of knowledge that the chatbot can draw from if the information in the doctor-patient transcript is not sufficient.

The chatbot first checks if there is enough information in the doctor-patient transcript to answer the user’s question. If not, it checks the knowledge base, and then general information. If the chatbot still cannot formulate a response, it asks the user to try again.

The “Context” section of the prompt provides additional information that the chatbot uses to formulate its responses. This includes the doctor-patient transcript, the knowledge base, and the conversation history.

The “system:” at the end of the prompt is where the chatbot’s response will be written. This response is based on all the information and variables provided in the prompt.
